# Data Scientist Nanodegree (Term 2)

Content for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree curriculum, which includes project and lesson content.




## 1. Installation

 The code should run with no issues using Python versions  3.6 and 3.7.



## 2. Project motivations

Purpose is to learn how to built a packages and to upload it to PyPi (pypi.org).

https://pypi.org/project/distributions-dirkkadijk/0.1/#files



## 3. Data source

na



## 4. Summary of the results


In folder you'll find three files:

- 'Binomialdistribution.py`: Generic distribution class for calculating and visualizing a probability distribution.

- `Gaussiandistribution.py`: Gaussian distribution class for calculating and visualizing a Gaussian distribution.

- 'Binomialdistribution.py`: The 3rd package in the distributions_dirkkadijk package is with a new class called Binomial distribution class for calculating and visualizing a Binomial distribution.

You can click on the package py-files to look at how the 'Distribution class' and 'Gaussian class' are modularized into different files. 
E.g. the Gaussiandistribution.py imports Distribution class from the Generaldistribution.py file. The line of code:

> from Generaldistribution import Distribution

essentially pastes the Distribution code to the top of the Gaussiandistribution file when you run the code.
